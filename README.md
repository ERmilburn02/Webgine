# Webgine

A web game engine made in Typescript.

## Features

<!-- TODO: As parts of the engine are made, move them from Upcoming to here -->

And more are currently in development

## Upcoming features

- Multiple game instances at a time

## Installation

Until Webgine has a beta release, installation instructions will not be provided as the engine will not be usable.

<!-- Webgine can either be imported as a module from npm, or used directly in the browser. -->
<!-- To use directly in the browser, simply include `webgine.js` before running any game code -->
<!-- To use with a bundler, install `@ermilburn02/webgine` from the NPM registry. -->
<!-- To the person reading the comments, the engine isn't yet on NPM, so don't try to install it. I will put it on NPM once it's ready for beta. -->
